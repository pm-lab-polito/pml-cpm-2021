# CPM - Authoring documents

Documents are authored using markdown format (.md). A guide to .md can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Slides

To prepare slides we will use a markdown extension [Marpit](https://marpit.marp.app/) that can be edited via Visual Studio Code, installing the extension [Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode)

Images have to be inserted using the markdown directive

``` markdown
![alt text](url of the image)
```

Diagrams, such as schemas, frameworks, etc. can be edited with
* the drawio extension, saved as *filename*.drawio.svg
* the mermaid format, see [a reference](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/gantt)
