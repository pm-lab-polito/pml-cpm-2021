# Objective of the work, team formation and organization

The term project is aimed at learning Project Management by doing. This will be obtained via reproducing in an academic context the real-life process of preparing, monitoring and controlling a project management plan in compliance to the course lecture and using the PMBoK as a reference.

Most of the work will be executed using Microsoft Project (Standard or Professional). The software package is available on all LEP workstations. Also, it is possible to download the software thanks to the academic alliance between Politecnico di Torino and Microsoft ([http://msdnaa.polito.it/](http://msdnaa.polito.it/)). A few recitation hours will be spent to let everybody get started with using the software tool.

The work will be performed in small teams. The maximum number of members per team is to be defined according to the total number of students in the class. All members will cooperate on the job and nominate a team leader (i.e.: Project Manager) in charge of coordinating the team and monitoring the job status during the full term. It is mandatory to blend the composition of team members in nationality and gender.

Each team will work in a professional and autonomous manner. We recommend adopting a team-collaboration software tool such as Trello, Freedcamp, Jira, etc. Some of these tools are made available to students by requesting access to the [pm-lab.polito.it workbench](https://pm-lab.polito.it/portfolio) ([https://pm-lab.polito.it/portfolio](https://pm-lab.polito.it/portfolio))

On a weekly basis, the teams will meet the instructors to report about the job done, get information and suggestion for the next steps. These meetings are according to the timetable provided by instructors. Simultaneously, in the LEP computer room TA will provide information, tips and assistance on using the Microsoft Project software tool.

The schedule of submission is detailed in the next section. Final presentations will be held for those teams that make it to the shortlist to present live (see &quot;Presentation to Steering Committee&quot; in the next section). Shortlisted teams will be notified after submission.

# Scope of Term Project

As part of an international project, this work reproduces the real-life process of preparing, monitoring and controlling a management plan to supply a Swing Bridge for a Metro Stay Cabled Bridge in Istanbul, Turkey.

## Project background

Your company received from the Owner a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Swing Bridge Manufacturing and Assembly Project. See RFP-CL (cover letter) and RFP.

Your company submitted a bid following Client&#39;s RFP, please see BID.

That bid was successful, and your company received the Notification of winning proposer. Discussion between the Client and your Proposal Manager where held to clarify some commercial terms as recorded in the Memoranda&#39;s Addendum 1.

Then, due to negative conjuncture, your company has agreed to a Client&#39;s request to stand-by the project for 4 years. The Notification is still valid, subject to conditions as per Memoranda&#39;s Addendum 1.

Now your company has received a notice from the Client to proceed with the project and your CEO has signed the Project agreement as per the documents referenced above and Memoranda&#39;s Addendum 2.

The timing for commencement and submittals is as follows (reference is made to Agreement relevant clauses):

| Date | Contract term | Term | Special conditions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 27/08/2019 | Agreement effective |
 |
 |
| 07/10/2019 | Commencement of work |
 | Clause 7.1 (41 days) |
| 12/11/2019 | Submittal of Planning deliverables | D1 | Clause 7.3 (36 days) |
| 18/11/2019 | Project variance report | D2, D3 |
 |
| **17/12/2019** | **Submittal of recovery plan report** | **D4** |
 |
| 30/12/2019 | Notification of Shortlisted recovery plans | D5 |

# Capstone – Process guidelines (as PMBoK fifth edition)

To understand the following instructions, it is highly suggested to have a working understating of the PMBoK (available in the &quot;Readings&quot; folder on the course website).

![](RackMultipart20210922-4-19bewka_html_ded0b601f4422253.png)

## Initiating Process - Submit by effective date D1

### 4.1 Develop Project Charter (Integration Management)

Be sure to summarize all available information into a Project Charter, prepared based on a template of your own choosing. **Deliver it as a MS Word file**.

## Planning - Submit by effective date D1

### 4.2 Develop a Project Management Plan (Integration Management)

Be sure to develop a fruitful team-working environment. Brainstorm different project conditions arising from late commencement of the work. Submit a Project Management Plan, under the form of a Memorandum of Key Facts and Figures. **Deliver it as a Power Point file.**

### 7. Cost Management

Prepare a Cost Summary, including Direct Cost, Overhead Cost, Contingency Budget and Interest on Capital. **Deliver it as a MS Excel file, using the Price Breakdown template (BID\_PBD)**. Use the data from the BID Price Breakdown for the Overhead Calculation. For Interest use the results of the Cash Flow analysis. For Contingency Budget use the results from your Risk Management activities (see below).

Prepare project Cash flow following Article 8 – Payment Scheme in the RFP Condition of Contract. Assume that annual interest rate is 6% on overdraft and 2% on positive bank account balance. For Contingency use the results from your Risk Management activities (see below). Assume that the Owner pays 20% of the Price at the start, and the remaining 80% in monthly instalments once the erection phase has started. Monthly instalments are paid by the owner in relation to the amount of work completed in the period. Owner pays instalments associated with actual value of the work progresson Owner&#39;s site. **Deliver it as a MS Excel file**.

### 11. Risk Management

Risks are identified in the risk register file integrating these instructions. Assume that the only tasks subjected to risks are the following: all &quot;Detailed Engineering&quot; tasks, &quot;Swing Bridge Installation&quot;, &quot;Pre-assembly on site&quot; and &quot;Transportation of Lift and Turn Cylinder&quot;. Evaluate worst case (95% confidence interval) for Cost Index (CI) and Schedule Index (SI) for these tasks. Apply CI to tasks costs and SI to tasks durations and determine the new direct costs and project duration. Delays contingency shall be obtained applying liquidated damages agreed in Memorandum 1 (RFP\_ME1). **Deliver Contingency Budget calculations in a MS Excel File** and pass Contingency figure to cost management. **Deliver new project schedule at risk in a MS Project file**.

## Monitoring &amp; Control - Submit by effective date D4

### 4. Integration Management

Obtain **progress report by D3**. Revise the documents prepared on the Planning phase following the Company&#39;s PMO Best Practices.

Based on forecasted completion delays and risk management results, prepare a contingency report and recommendations to management. Suggest the value of the premium you may want to ask for recovered completion. Please present various scenarios for mitigation and time management necessary to identify the recommended one. **Deliver it as a MS Excel file fully supported by all backup documents as needed (MS Project and MS Excel).**

Prepare a value engineering accelerated plan (see RFP\_CoC Clause 6.2) to be presented to the project steering meeting. In the plan, you should present the recommended course of action, proposing your revised budget at completion. **Deliver it as a MS Powerpoint presentation.**

Note: keep in mind that your deliverables will be evaluated by highly skilled Project Management professionals, keep it technical!

The recommended scenario will then be evaluated by:

- Expected Net Profit Margin (NPM) of the proposed scenario: Price – (Direct Costs + Mitigation Costs) – Overhead Costs – Financial Costs;
- Risk Weighted Margin: NPM – Contingency Budget (of the proposed scenario);
- Quality of plan presentation, backup report and records ~~;~~

**On date D5 you will be notified if you have been shortlisted to present on effective date D6.**

### 6. Time Management

Save MS Project network schedule as baseline. Record progress. Recalculate schedule network and critical path. Evaluate project delays. **Deliver it in a MS Project file**.

### 11. Risk Management

Evaluate new critical path&#39;s Cost Index and Schedule Index. If needed suggest mitigation measures as stipulated in risk registers.
