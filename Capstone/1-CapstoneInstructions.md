# Contruction Project Management Course

## Fall Term - Academic Year 2021-22

## **Capstone Project**

Instructors:

* Paolo Eugenio Demagistris
* Gabriel 

---

# Objective of the work

The term project is aimed at learning Project Management by doing. This will be obtained via reproducing in an academic context the real-life process of preparing, monitoring and controlling a project management plan in compliance to the course lecture and using the PMBoK as a reference.

Most of the work will be executed using Microsoft Project (Standard or Professional). The software package is available on all LEP workstations. Also, it is possible to download the software thanks to the academic alliance between Politecnico di Torino and Microsoft ([http://msdnaa.polito.it/](http://msdnaa.polito.it/)). A few recitation hours will be spent to let everybody get started with using the software tool.

---

# Team formation

The work will be performed in small teams. The maximum number of members per team is to be defined according to the total number of students in the class. All members will cooperate on the job and nominate a team leader (i.e.: Project Manager) in charge of coordinating the team and monitoring the job status during the full term. It is mandatory to blend the composition of team members in nationality and gender.

Each team will work in a professional and autonomous manner. We recommend adopting a team-collaboration software tool such as Trello, Freedcamp, Jira, etc. Some of these tools are made available to students by requesting access to the [pm-lab.polito.it workbench](https://pm-lab.polito.it/portfolio) ([https://pm-lab.polito.it/portfolio](https://pm-lab.polito.it/portfolio))

---

#  Organization

On a weekly basis, the teams will meet the instructors to report about the job done, get information and suggestion for the next steps. These meetings are according to the timetable provided by instructors. Simultaneously, in the LEP computer room TA will provide information, tips and assistance on using the Microsoft Project software tool.

The schedule of submission is detailed in the next section. Final presentations will be held for those teams that make it to the shortlist to present live (see &quot;Presentation to Steering Committee&quot; in the next section). Shortlisted teams will be notified after submission.

# Scope of Term Project

As part of an international project, this work reproduces the real-life process of preparing a Bid (ie. Proposal) to supply a Swing Bridge, in response to a Tender from an Owner, within the Metro Stay Cabled Bridge Program, located in Istanbul, Turkey.

# Project background

Your company received from the Owner a request to Bid for thei Tender - Swing Bridge Manufacturing and Assembly Project. 
See 2-1-Tender-CL (cover letter) and 2-2-Tender-IB (instruction to Bidders).

*This assignment is inspired by, but not consistent with, a real project that has been completed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horn_Metro_Bridge). Most pieces of information and data have been adjusted for educational purposes only and non-confidential information from the project has been used for developing this case.*

Assume that the only tasks subjected to risks are the following: all &quot;Detailed Engineering&quot; tasks, &quot;Swing Bridge Installation&quot;, &quot;Pre-assembly on site&quot; and &quot;Transportation of Lift and Turn Cylinder&quot;. Evaluate worst case (95% confidence interval) for Cost Index (CI) and Schedule Index (SI) for these tasks. Apply CI to tasks costs and SI to tasks durations and determine the new direct costs and project duration. Delays contingency shall be obtained applying liquidated damages agreed in Memorandum 1 (RFP\_ME1). **Deliver Contingency Budget calculations in a MS Excel File** and pass Contingency figure to cost management. **Deliver new project schedule at risk in a MS Project file**.
