# Understanding today's Construction

>The construction industry, and its broader ecosystem, erects buildings, infrastructure, and industrial structures.
Construction is the **biggest industry in the world**, and it is not performing well. The AEC represents 13 percent of global GDP, but construction has seen a productivity growth of 1 percent annually for the past two decades. Time and cost overruns are the norm, and overall earnings (EBIT) are only around 5 percent.
