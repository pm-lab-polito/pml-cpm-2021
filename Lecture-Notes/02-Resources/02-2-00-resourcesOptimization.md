# Limits of Scope - Time - Cost Scheduling

The process flow above is informed by the traditional Scope - Time - Cost approach.

Typically:

- Deliverables dictate scope
- Scope dictates activities newtwork
- Activities have a determined duration and cost
- Resources are defined to fullfill scope timing and cost requirement

This approach is valid only for high level scheduling and should be used only for setting targets.

# Nature of activities' duration and cost

Duration = work * units
