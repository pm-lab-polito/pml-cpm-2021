# Introduction to Construction Project Management (CPM)

### Paolo Eugenio Demagistris

---

# Construction Management definition:

* a practice of professional management applied to the AEC context

* applied to the planning, design, and construction of projects
* from inception to completion
* for the purpose of controlling time, scope, cost, and quality

## application of integrated systems and procedures by a team of professionals to achieve the owner‘s goals

---
# Construction project management

The main function of Construction Management

Based on generic PM standards, such as ISO21500:2012 (used throughout this course), ISO21502:2020, PMI PMBoK, IPMA ICB4, defined by

> project: temporary endeavour to achieve one or more defined objectives
> 
> project management: coordinated activities to direct and control the accomplishment of agreed objectives

> *from ISO 21502*

# Construction Project Management

## Breaking down the terms:

AS we are going to spend many weeks describing systems and procedures that apply to CPM,

The next slides are aimed at clarity on what we mean by each term.

# Construction

![broad and narrow](../img/m-01-01.png)

---

# Thus, two perspectives for the Construction

The  **narrow  sector**:

* solely *on-site  assembly*  including:
  * site  preparation,
  * constructions  of  buildings  and  infrastructure,  
  * building  installation  and  building  completion  (decoration).

The **broader definition** includes:

* the supply chain for construction related  products
* the professional  services  such  as management,  architecture,  design  and  facilities  management. 

---

# Management

Management’s primary function is 
* to get people to work together 
* for the attainment of an organization’s goals and objectives
* using available resources efficiently and effectively

Organizations are systems, management is a supervisor, defined as:
>human action to facilitate the production of useful outcomes from a system.

# Management cycle

![management cycle](../img/m-01-02.drawio.png)

---

# Management: Plan

* Investigate the current situation
* fully understand the nature of the problem being solved
* formulate the key tasks
* detail the activities to execute the task
* specify the desired outcomes and results.

---

# Management: Do

* Gather data to assess extent and specifics of tasks
* Define a coherent body of information to define activities
* Assign responsibilities and resources to activities
* Direct the execution
* Lead, monitor and control

---

# Management: Check

* monitor the effect of the implementation plan
* find countermeasures if necessary to further improve the solution
* check during implementation that the objectives are being met
* check at completion
* allow for successes and failures to be addressed
* collect lessons learned.

---

# Management: Act

* Implement your solutions and recommendations
* Decide if the solution is effective
* Integrate it into standard work practices or abandon it
* ask what you’ve learned from the process
* restart the cycle.

# Project As a Framework

![PrjFrwrk](../img/m-01-03.png)

---

# Project Framework explained

* The broad **external environment** drives the existence of an organization
* The **organization environment** is setup to deliver **benefits** to organization's stakeholders
* benefits are created by **operations**, that are defined as:
* >business operations: collectively, everything that happens within a company to keep it running and earning money.
* **Benefits** are sustained by **organizational strategy**
* strategy defines **deliverables** that are needed and implemented to sustain operation's benefits  delivery.

---

# Organizational strategy

* a master plan, such as a portfolio of projects
* charting the course of action of organization's executives
* based on a set of decisions
* to achieve the organization's objectives, that are
  * secure a competitive position in the market
  * carry on its operations
  * please customers
  * deliver organization's intended benefits, mission, vision and values

---

# Formation of strategy

![strategy](../img/m-01-04.png)

* Opportunities are identified and evaluated through environment intelligence
* Management selects the opportunities that could deliver benefits
* Opportunities are new environment features that impact on the organization, eg.:
  * new market demand
  * current operations' need
  * new legal requirement

---

# Formation of a project

![prjForm](../img/m-01-05.drawio.svg)

---

# Business Case

* A project environment is created if there is a **Business Case** for it
* Business Case is a methodology to evaluate if the opportunity is feasible, ie.
  * Benefits are higher than costs, financially and socially
  * Impacts are coherent with organization's values and overall strategy
* It's a project Master Plan: the course of action is defined and evaluated
* A Project Sponsor is named, responsible for the business case and accountable for project goals and benefits

---

# Project Governance

* A framework to direct the project organization to achieve the Business Case
* Project governance includes:
  * Mechanisms to define the management structure
  * policies, processes and methodologies to be used
  * limits of authority for decision-making
  * stakeholder responsibilities and accountabilities
  * interactions such as reporting and the escalation of issues or risks
  
The responsibility for implementing project governance is assigned to the project sponsor or to a project steering committee.

---

# Project Organization

Designing, implementing, improving the processes happening between **stakeholders** to execute the project deliverables

* According to Business Case goals, ie. Achieving the benefits expected from the opportunity 
* According to Deliverables requirements as stated in the Business Case

**Stakeholders** are defined as:
>person, group or organization that has interests in, or can affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by, any aspect of the project

**They include all project operatives.**

---

# Project's Groups of processes:

* Deliverables are constructed, in the narrow sense, by **Product processes**, such as pouring concrete, setting out foundations, etc.
* Product processes are orchestrated by **Project Management Processes**, as the production must be coordinated with:
  * the Business Case and the environment, both external and organizational
  * the Stakeholders
  * the constraints (time, quality, money)

---

# Product vs. PM processes

Stakeholders perform work to contribute to the project. This work is either Product or Project related.

### Product processes
* are performed by relatively stable teams through ongoing and repetitive processes
* are focused on sustaining the organization

### Project Management processes
* are performed by temporary teams so are non-repetitive
* provide unique deliverables

---

# Construction project deliverables

In construction project deliverables are composed of many built elements. A taxonomy of deliverables can be found in OmniClass, Table 21 - Elements, defined as:
>An Element is a major component, assembly, or “construction entity part which, in itself or in combination with other parts, fulfills a predominating function of the construction entity.

---

# OmniClass, Elements, Table 21

Example

#### 21-02 00 00 Shell

* 21-02 10 Superstructure
  * 21-02 10 10 Floor Construction
    * 21-02 10 10 10 Floor Structural Frame

    * 21-02 30 10 70 Canopy Roofing

---

# Construction product processes

In construction many product processes are executed. A taxonomy of these products can be found in OmniClass, Table 22 - Work Results, defined as:
>Work Results are construction results achieved in the production stage and identified by one or more of the following:

>* the particular skill or trade involved;
>* the construction resources used
>* the part of the construction entity which results.

---

# OmniClass, Work Results, Table 22

# Project life cycle

As projects are **temporary** they only span a determined life cycle.

They are constrained by a start and an end, both defined in the Business Case, monitored through the Project Governance mechanisms.

The life cycle is broken into stages:

* to allow for intermediate monitoring.
* defined by partial deliveries using resources
* are sequenced and time related.

---

# Project Management Processes

* Purpose: orchestrate production processes to deliver within project constraints
* To be designed based on recognized body of practice, taylored to project need
* Addressing project complexity through proper coordination among them
  
---

# PM Processes Groups


![procGr](../img/m-01-06.drawio.svg)

---

# CPM as Business Process Management (BPM)

A business process is 

* a collection of linked tasks 
* that find their end in the delivery of a service or product to a client. 

A business process has also been defined as
* a set of activities and tasks 
* that, once completed, will accomplish an organizational goal. 

The process must involve clearly defined inputs and a single output. 

---

# Business Process

A business process includes at least one of, but not limited to, the following elements:

* task/ activity
* system
* employee(s)
* workflow
* data

---

# Features of a Business Process

Key attributes that distinguish business processes from other business tasks and activities are: 

* a process is repeatable
* a process is flexible and not rigid
* a process is specific and has established start and endpoints
* a process is measurable

---

# Processes vs. Projects

A project is focused on creating something new or implementing a change

A process is focused on creating value by repeatedly performing a task.

Simply put, projects are activities that you have never performed in your business before, whereas processes are activities that you do repeatedly.

---

# Processes vs Procedures

A process is a flow of business activities that are connected toward the achievement of a business outcome,

Whereas a procedure is a prescribed way of undertaking a process or part of a process. 

While a process is a set of defined actions, a procedure is a set of instructions that are detailed in nature.

# Introduction to CPM: key take aways

* Construction delivery is basically about delivering a project, as
  * Each construction is unique
  * Construction happens along a life cycle, with a start and an end
  * Construction is uncertain by nature and CPM is used to deal with this
* CPM is a collection of processes to effectively deliver value to Construction Owner, by enabling its benefit realization through improved operations.

---

# Introduction to CPM: key take aways (cont.)

* Construction is based on a Owner driven strategic business case that leverages on opportunities to deliver benefit realization
* CPM is about
  * Governing the project
  * Designing and executing PM processes
  * That orchestrate through baselines and control
  * Product processes that
  * Actually produce the elemets that form the deliverables
