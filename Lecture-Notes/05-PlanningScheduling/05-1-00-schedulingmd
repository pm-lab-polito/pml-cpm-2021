### Deterministic scheduling

Basics of structuring breakdowns of project activities (WBS and CBS)

Principles applying to deterministic scheduling process

Standard scheduling documents, primary scheduling methods

## Scheduling > Organizational Challenge

* The project environment needs a detailed schedule showing the planned start and end times of the project activities to establish the overall project schedule baseline.
* Although there are more simplistic approaches, the Network diagramming technique allows to calculate project timing based on estimated activities durations, resource constraints and sequence of activities.

---

### Network diagramming - Inputs

* Clarify the project scope, including objectives, deliverables, requirements and boundaries, by defining the end state of the project. Obtain: **Scope statement, Requirements**
* Provide a hierarchical decomposition framework for presenting the work that needs to be completed, in order to achieve the project objectives. Obtain **WBS**
* WBS can be developed using standardized decomposition logics (see Omniclass in links)

### Network diagramming - Detail the nodes

* Obtain the WBS from Scope group of processes
* Detail activities that are to be implemented in a **monitored way**.
* Assign:
  * estimated deterministic duration
  * estimated costs
  * resources

### Network diagramming - Detail the links

* Establish the logical and objective system of relationships (precedences and dependencies) between activities.
* Type of relationships:
  * End - Start
  * Start - Start
  * End - End
* It is also possible to assign lags and overlaps, using the Precedence Diagramming Method. However this makes the network model improperly formed

### Network diagramming - CPM: solve the Network

* Once we have defined the network nodes and links we can fully calculate the key time metrics required to manage a time schedule:
* Early start and end: the earliest dates an activity can start and therefore end
* Late start and end: the latest dates an activity can start and therefore end **without delaying the project**
* The floats (or slacks im MsProject's parlance) as the difference between late minus early set of dates.
* It represents the freedom we have in moving in time our activities, tuning start, duration and therefore end to suit various project requirements.

### Network diagramming > CPM: the Algorithm

Using a scheduling system the CPM algorithm is transparent to the user.
See this video for details https://youtu.be/-TDh-5n90vk

---


### Network diagramming > Critical path

The Critical Path(CP) and it is the longest of all paths in the network system.

In all network based project there at least one Critical Path, that has no slack: the activities in this path must be completed on time, otherwise the entire project will be delayed.

---

## Network diagramming > Managing paths

Network diagramming allows to see project timing according to all the possible paths leading from project's start to end.

Each path possesses a total float, the sum of path's activities float.

While the the Critical path is the longest at planning time, project uncertainty may lead to changes in durations. Implementing new durations in the CPM algorithm may yield different paths.

---

### Network diagramming > Indexing paths

Path priority index

$$

\lambda_{path}=\frac{\alpha_2-\beta}{\alpha_2-\alpha_1}\\
\alpha_1:min(slack_{paths})=0\\
\alpha_2:Max(slack_{paths})\\
\beta:slack_{path}

$$

In this way, we can classify all paths and pay attention as ฮป is high
